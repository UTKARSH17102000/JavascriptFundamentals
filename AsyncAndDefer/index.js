// Great question! The async and defer attributes in HTML script tags are used to control how and when external JavaScript files are loaded and executed. Let's break down their differences and discuss when to use each.

// 1.
// Regular <script> tag (without async or defer):

// <script src="script.js"></script>

// Blocks HTML parsing while the script is being fetched and executed.
// Scripts are executed in the order they appear in the document.


// 2.
// <script async> tag:

// <script async src="script.js"></script>

// Fetches the script asynchronously while HTML parsing continues.
// Executes the script as soon as it's downloaded, potentially before HTML parsing is complete.
// Does not guarantee execution order for multiple async scripts.


// 3.
// <script defer> tag:

// <script defer src="script.js"></script>

// Fetches the script asynchronously while HTML parsing continues.
// Defers execution until HTML parsing is complete.
// Maintains the order of execution for multiple deferred scripts.


// Key Differences:

// 1.
// Parsing Behavior:
// Regular: Blocks parsing
// Async: Non-blocking
// Defer: Non-blocking
// 2.
// Execution Timing:
// Regular: Executes immediately
// Async: Executes as soon as downloaded
// Defer: Executes after HTML parsing is complete
// 3.
// Order of Execution:
// Regular: Maintains order
// Async: No guaranteed order
// Defer: Maintains order
// 4.
// DOMContentLoaded Event:
// Regular and Async: May fire before all scripts have executed
// Defer: Waits for deferred scripts to execute before firing


// When to use each:

// Use async when:
// The script is independent and doesn't rely on other scripts or fully parsed DOM.
// You want the script to run as soon as possible.
// Order of execution is not important (e.g., analytics scripts, ads).


// Example:
// <script async src="analytics.js"></script>

// Use defer when:
// The script depends on a fully parsed DOM.
// You want to maintain the order of script execution.
// You want to improve page load performance without changing the script's behavior.


// Example:
// <script defer src="app.js"></script>
// <script defer src="components.js"></script>

// Use regular <script> (no attribute) when:
// The script is inline (not using src attribute).
// The script is critical for the initial render and must execute immediately.
// You're working with older browsers that don't support async/defer.


// Example:
// <script>
//   // Critical initialization code
// </script>

// Best Practices:
// 1.
// Use defer for most of your scripts, especially those that manipulate the DOM or depend on other scripts.
// 2.
// Use async for independent scripts like analytics or ads.
// 3.
// Place scripts at the end of the <body> tag when not using async or defer.
// 4.
// Combine and minify scripts to reduce the number of HTTP requests.


// By choosing the appropriate script loading strategy, you can significantly improve your page's loading performance and user experience.



// Great question! Let's clarify the behavior of the async attribute in script tags.

// When using the async attribute, the HTML parsing does not stop while the script is being fetched. However, there's an important distinction to make regarding the execution of the script:

// 1.
// Script Fetching:
// HTML parsing continues uninterrupted while the script is being downloaded.
// This is one of the main benefits of async, as it allows the browser to continue parsing the HTML while fetching the script in parallel.
// 2.
// Script Execution:
// Once the script is fully downloaded, its execution will interrupt the HTML parsing.
// The script runs immediately, regardless of whether the HTML parsing is complete or not.


// So, to answer your question directly:

// HTML parsing does not stop during the fetching of an async script.
// HTML parsing does stop briefly when an async script is executed.


// Here's a visual representation:
// HTML Parsing: -------|  |------
// Async Script:    <--->|  |
//                  Fetch| Execute

// Key points to remember:

// 1.
// The async attribute allows the script to be downloaded without blocking HTML parsing.
// 2.
// The execution of the async script will pause HTML parsing, but only after the script has been fully downloaded.
// 3.
// This behavior can lead to unpredictable execution order if you have multiple async scripts, as they will execute as soon as they're downloaded, regardless of their order in the HTML.


// This is different from defer, which waits until HTML parsing is complete before executing:
// HTML Parsing: ----------------|
// Defer Script:    <--->        |-->
//                  Fetch        Execute

// In practice, this means:

// Use async for independent scripts that don't rely on the DOM structure or other scripts.
// Use defer for scripts that need the full DOM or must execute in a specific order.


// Remember, the main advantage of async is that it allows the script to be downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing, potentially improving overall page load time, especially for scripts that are hosted on different servers.
